- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @talram
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Natural Language Processing and Recommendation Systems.
- ðŸŒ± In here you can find my project on a recommender system for a library (my first project).
- âœ¨ I developed a content-based filtering recommender system in Python, 
      which includes the ML algorithm: tf-idf. 
      I deployed it to Heroku server and implemented it using Flask and Pandas.
- ðŸŒ± My last project is on Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification, 
      using NLP techniques, and the Python libraries: Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow.

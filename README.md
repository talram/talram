- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @talram
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis and recommender systems.
- ğŸŒ± In here you can find my project on a recommender system for a library.
- âœ¨ I developed a content-based filtering recommender system in Python, 
     which includes the ML algorithm: tf-idf. 
     I deployed it to Heroku server and implemented it using Flask and Pandas.
